GOES 6 and 7 magnetometer data retrieved from:
https://satdat.ngdc.noaa.gov/sem/goes/data/full/fits/magnetometer/1989/
in FITS format.

The files were parsed and a short section pulled out and written to JSON-headed ASCII.
The FITS header information is written in the FITS_HEADER attribute in the
JSON metadata.
The binary flag word has been converted from a coded integer to a string representation
of the binary. See the FITS header for details on what each bit means.

To read the file in SpacePy and correctly convert quantities on read,
>>> import spacepy.datamodel as dm
>>> import dateutil.parser as dup
>>> test6 = dm.readJSONheadedASCII('goes6_magnetometer_11-16March1989.txt',
                                   convert={'Flag': str, 'DateTime': dup.parse})
